# Project3 - Replicate SincNet Results

# Reason
This Project recreated results from the [original SincNet repo](https://github.com/mravanelli/SincNet). The SincNet repo was executed for its unique technique for training the machine to filter out data. 

# How SincNet CNN works
SincNet uses CNN to filter out a signal efficiently. The SincNet model 

# How is it efficient

[1] Does not require as many outputs as other machine learning techiques for filtering because it only outputs the start and stop frequencies for filtering
[2] Since the data is segmented SincNet can detect frequencies to filter out sooner than most models
